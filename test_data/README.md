# About the test_data directory

The files in this folder are meant to be used with Postman to test each document and ensure that it properly handles JSON data.

There are files labeled by document type which are intended to test that document specifically, ignoring all others, and then 
the 'global_test.json' file is meant to test all documents that can be created by the document generator.
